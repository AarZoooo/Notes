# UNIT 1

## Measure of Central Tendency

A single value which can represent a collection of data. Also called **Average Value**. When it comes to comparing two or more large datasets, in that case we summarise the dataset into a single value, which generally lies at the center of the dataset.

**Types of Measure of Central Tendency:**

1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

## Mean

Value obtained by dividing the sum of all observations by the total number of observations.

Mean = $\frac{Sumof all observations}{Number of observations}$

There are **three methods** to find mean:

1. Direct method
2. Short-cut method
3. Step deviation method

### Direct Method

**Symbols:**

- x̄ = Mean
- xᵢ = each observation
- n = number of observations
- A = assumed center observation

- f = frequency of each group
- N = 

For **Ungrouped data:**

x̄ = $\frac{\sum xᵢ}{n}$

**Example:**



For **Grouped data:**

x̄ = $\frac{\sum f x}{N}$
