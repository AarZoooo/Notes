Hi!
I'm **AarZoo**, a student of Chandigarh University, pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.

This is my repository for storing my academic notes and sharing them to my friends in need. I recently realized that markdown is an awesome tool for creating digital notes, and can be easily stored in cloud storages like github and can be made sharable. So in my 4th semester, I started this repository.

I will be keeping and updating notes here according to my curriculum. 

Suggestions and contributions are absolutely welcome.
